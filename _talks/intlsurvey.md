Abstract: 

Although scholars have been skeptical about the effect of international law on state behavior,
recent studies show that non-state actors such as human rights activists pressure governments
to comply with international laws, and that the general public in advanced democracies tend to
disapprove of government practices that violate them. However, the motivation for negative public
attitudes toward international law violations is yet to be disentangled. We design a survey experiment
in Japan to investigate two potential channels: respecting legal obligations and following globally standard practices.
We examine responses to treatments that highlight these features of international law on attitudes toward same-surname marriage,
whaling, hate speech regulation, and the death penalty. The results show that the legal obligation cue, 
which emphasizes that compliance with international law is a constitutional obligation, 
has a stronger effect on respondent attitudes than the global standards cue. We also find subgroup differences 
in treatment effect based on partisanship, beliefs about Japanâ€™s political influence in the world, 
and identification with global civil society. Our paper shows that domestic audiences value international law 
for its legal and constitutional standing, not because it signals global standards or norms.
